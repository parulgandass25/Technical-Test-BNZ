The difference between the hight of pink and blue bar for AFRO, EMRO and SEARO appears to be similar, representing they have had similar impact in terms deaths relative to the number of cases.

    "\n",
    "The choice between chart types depends on the specific analysis objectives and the information you want to convey. Let's discuss the suitability of each chart type in the given situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cases vs Deaths for Countries with more than 2 million cases**: The line plot is effective in representing the relationship between cases and deaths for individual countries (correlation between two variables). It helps identify countries that deviate from the overall trend and provides insights into the severity of the situation in different nations. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Line graphs provide an excellent way to map dependent variables that are both quantitative. When both variables are quantitative, the line segment that connects two points on the graph expresses a slope, which can be interpreted visually relative to the slope of other lines. This chart type allows for direct comparison between the number of cases and deaths for individual countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Multiple line graphs have space-saving characteristics over a comparable grouped bar graph. Because the data values are marked by small marks (points) and not bars, they do not have to be offset from each other. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The bar chart might become cluttered with the large number of countries. It might also be challenging to visualize the trends for each country.\n",
    "    \n",
    ". \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compare Cases vs Deaths by WHO Region**: This double axis bar plot with allows for a comparison of cases vs death and the overall impact of COVID-19 across different regions. It helps identify regional patterns and differences in the relationship between cases and deaths with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bar graphs are better for comparing larger changes or differences in data among groups. Bar graphs are best to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time. A line chart's primary variable is also numeric and continuous (WHO rehion is our scenario) which shows the connection between data points in one line instead of bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This chart type enables comparison between different WHO regions, providing an overview of the distribution of cases and deaths across regions. It can help identify regions with higher case or death counts and detect any regional disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate chart type depends on the nature of the data and the specific insights you want to convey. Both chart types are suitable for their respective situations because they emphasize different aspects of the data. The first chart focuses on individual countries, highlighting outliers and individual country characteristics, while the second chart emphasizes regional differences and patterns."

    "Having a deeper look at the situation in India over the period, we can see 3 surges/waves. With 2nd wave resulting in the highest spread. Zoomin in on the first wave, it hit India during mid May 2020 with highest cases recorded during mid Sep 2020. Second wave has had the highest impact, with highest number cases recorded in 1st week of May 2021.\n",

    "## The data is very interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is interesting because it allows us to analyze the impact of COVID-19 across countries and regions. We can observe the variations in the number of cases and deaths and identify the most affected areas. By comparing the cases and deaths, we can gain insights into the severity of the disease and its impact on different parts of world.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This data reveals countries that have experienced a significant number of cases but relatively low mortality (or vice versa), indicating potential differences in healthcare systems, demographics, or other factors influencing outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The provided COVID-19 data offers valuable insights into the global impact of the virus. These visualizations provide different perspectives on the data and can help understand the trends, patterns, and variations in the COVID-19 situation across countries and WHO regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data shows the variation in the total number of cases across different countries, providing insights into the geographical spread of the pandemic. It draws attention to the countries facing challenges in managing the impact of the virus on public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows us to compare the impact of the virus across different regions. It helps identify regions with higher or lower mortality rates relative to the number of cases, providing insights into potential variations in healthcare infrastructure, policies, and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By examining the data from multiple perspectives and visualizing it in different ways, we can gain a deeper understanding of the global COVID-19 situation and identify areas where further investigation or intervention may be needed."
